# Tutorial: common

This project implements a **sophisticated image viewing system** in React that allows users to display and preview images. The system features a *smart image component* that handles both thumbnail and full-screen views, with **smooth animations** and **responsive sizing**. It includes built-in *error handling* for missing images and integrates with **analytics tracking** to monitor user interactions. The styling is managed through a *styled-components system* that ensures consistent and customizable appearance.
